## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
-   **Secure User Authentication**: Full registration and login flow using JWT for secure authentication. Passwords are fully hashed using `bcrypt`.
-   **JWT Handling**: Tokens are securely stored on the client-side and sent with protected requests.
-   **Protected Routes**: Backend middleware protects sensitive routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access or modify their own content.
-   **Session Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for wellness sessions.
-   **Draft & Publish System**: Users can save sessions as drafts and publish them when they are ready, making them publicly visible.

### Bonus & Advanced Features
-   **Auto-Save in Editor**: The session editor automatically saves a draft 2 seconds after the user stops typing, with clear UI feedback.
-   **Live Session Status**: Users can set their published sessions to "Live," which displays a blinking indicator on the main dashboard.
-   **Session Analytics**: The platform tracks and displays the number of views for each session.
-   **User Profile Management**: A dedicated page where users can view their email and update their name.
-   **Search & Filter**: The main dashboard includes a real-time search bar to filter sessions by title or tags.
-   **Copy to Clipboard**: A user-friendly feature to easily copy a session's JSON URL.
-   **Responsive UI**: The entire application, including the navigation bar, is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
-   **User Feedback**: The application provides clear feedback for all actions using toast notifications for success, error, and informational messages.
