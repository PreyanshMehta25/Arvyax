# Arvyax Wellness Session Platform

This is a full-stack application built for the Arvyax Full Stack Internship Assignment. It is a secure, scalable, and interactive platform that allows users to register, log in, view public wellness sessions, and manage their own custom sessions with features like drafts, publishing, and real-time status updates.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
-   **Secure User Authentication**: Full registration and login flow using JWT for secure authentication. Passwords are fully hashed using `bcrypt`.
-   **JWT Handling**: Tokens are securely stored on the client-side in both `localStorage` and cookies, and sent with protected requests.
-   **Protected Routes**: Backend middleware protects sensitive routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access or modify their own content.
-   **Session Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for wellness sessions.
-   **Draft & Publish System**: Users can save sessions as drafts and publish them when they are ready, making them publicly visible.

### Bonus & Advanced Features
-   **Auto-Save in Editor**: The session editor automatically saves a draft 2 seconds after the user stops typing, with clear UI feedback.
-   **Live Session Status**: Users can set their published sessions to "Live," which displays a blinking indicator on the main dashboard.
-   **Session Analytics**: The platform tracks and displays the number of views for each session.
-   **User Profile Management**: A dedicated page where users can view their email and update their name.
-   **Search & Filter**: The main dashboard includes a real-time search bar to filter sessions by title or tags.
-   **Image Uploads**: Users can upload a cover image for their sessions via Cloudinary, which is displayed on the dashboard.
-   **Copy to Clipboard**: A user-friendly feature to easily copy a session's JSON URL.
-   **Forgot Password Flow**: A complete password reset flow, including token generation and email sending via Nodemailer.
-   **Responsive UI**: The entire application, including the navigation bar, is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
-   **User Feedback**: The application provides clear feedback for all actions using toast notifications for success, error, and informational messages.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

-   `/frontend`: Contains the complete React.js client-side application.
-   `/backend`: Contains the Node.js, Express, and MongoDB server-side application.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   MongoDB (A free MongoDB Atlas account is recommended)
-   A Cloudinary account (for image hosting)
-   A Gmail account with an "App Password" (for the forgot password feature)

### 1. Backend Setup

First, navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into this new file and fill in your environment variables.

**.env.example**
```
# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET=yourSuperSecretKeyForSigningTokens

# Port for the server
PORT=5000

# Cloudinary Credentials (from your Cloudinary dashboard)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Nodemailer Credentials (use a Gmail App Password, not your regular password)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-gmail-app-password
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and install its dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend server at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the /backend directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the /frontend directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üîÆ Future Plans

The current platform provides a robust foundation. Future development could include:

-   **Real-Time Chat for Live Sessions**: Integrate WebSockets (using a library like Socket.IO) to allow users to chat in real-time during a "Live" session, enhancing engagement.
-   **Payment API Integration**: Introduce paid sessions by integrating a payment gateway like Stripe or Razorpay, allowing hosts to monetize their content.
